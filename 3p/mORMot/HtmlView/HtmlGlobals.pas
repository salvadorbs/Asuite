  Modification by A.Bouchez for Synopse - (C) 2013 A.Bouchez http://synopse.info
  - fork from r36 checked out via SVN from http://code.google.com/p/thtmlviewer
  - used to better integrate with the Htm2Pdf tool;
  - HTMLVIEWUSESYNGDIPLUS conditional is now defined in htmlcons.inc in
    order to handle GIF, JPEG and PNG pictures using our SynGdiPlus library:
    code is smaller, PNG are handled even before Delphi 2010, but animated GIFs
    are not handled any more
  - some small fixes, especially for Delphi 2010 compilation
