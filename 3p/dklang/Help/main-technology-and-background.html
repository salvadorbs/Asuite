<h2>VCL integration</h2>

<p>The package introduces a non-visual VCL component called <b>TDKLanguageController</b>, which is to be placed on each
  form you wish to localize. Language controller automatically maintains an internal list of all components and their
  properties of type String (also known as AnsiString or long string), ShortString and WideString (complete Unicode
  support is implemented). There's a little chance you will ever need another type of data to be changed in synch with
  language change.

<p>So, the language controller keeps a list of component properties, each having assigned a form-wide unique natural
  number identifier (ID). This is done transparently by the controller so you don't need to bother when you add or
  remove components to/from the form, or change their property values.

<p>Additionally, if a controller's <b>Options</b> include <b>dklcoAutoSaveLangSource</b> (this is the default), the
  controller saves its data in a plain text file (starting with version 3.0 of the package the file encoding is Unicode)
  into the so-called project language source, each time you save modifications to the form the controller is on. The
  project language source is a file named the same as the project (.dpr) file, but having .dklang extension. Each
  controller replaces the corresponding section in that file when it saves its data. If autosave is off you are still
  able to save the controller data by right-clicking the component on the form and selecting the <b>Save data to project
  language source</b> item. You may also select the <b>Project | Update project language source</b> main menu item, this
  will force all the contollers available for the project to update their language source in project's .dklang file.

<h2>Language Manager</h2>

<p>The package also introduces <b>TDKLanguageManager</b> class an instance of which is accessible via global function
  <b>LangManager</b>. The manager is instantiated first time the function is called. This will happen once a form having
  a controller will be instantiated, or when you invoke the LangManager e.&nbsp;g. to scan for language files (see the
  <a href="main-supplied-examples.html">provided examples</a>). Language manager performs all tasks of maintaining the
  list of available languages or switching between them.

<h2>Understanding constants</h2>

<p><b>Constants</b> are often used to display messages, titles, labels etc. in language that should match the program
  language. DKLang offers a simple yet functional solution of implementing constants.
  
<p>You define a set of constants in the default language of your project using <b>Project | Edit project
  constants...</b> IDE menu item (a project must be open in IDE). This opens <b>DKLang Constant Editor</b> dialog
  allowing you to review, edit, add or remove constants.

<p>In order to link constant resource file to your project add the following line to project source file (.dpr):<br>
  <div class=code>{$R *.dkl_const.res}</div>

<p>A constant entry consists of a <i>name</i> and a <i>value</i>.<br>
  <i>Constant name</i> must meet the standard Delphi identifier naming requirements, i.&nbsp;e. consist of alphanumric,
  digit and underscore characters only and not start with a digit; the name must be unique (case makes no sense) over
  the whole list.<br>
  <i>Constant value</i> is a WideString (Unicode) value which can also be empty.

<p>To read value of a constant you use its name (again, case-insensitively) and obtain a Unicode value using the function:

<div class=code>DKLangConstW('MyConstant') // Unicode</div>

<h2>Making a translation</h2>

<p>You may use freeware <a href="http://www.dk-soft.org/redir.php?product=dktraned&action=viewinfo" target=_blank>DKLang
  Translation Editor</a> application to open the language source files (.dklang), and to create new translations (.lng
  files) based on them.

<p><b>NB:</b> <b>Do not</b> edit .dklang files directly since the contents of these files are controlled automatically by
  language controllers and constant editor. Any changes to property mappings or constant values will be lost once the
  file is updated!<br>
  Nevertheless, you can add your custom comments (each line starting with a semicolon) at the top of the file. The
  package leaves such comments intact.
