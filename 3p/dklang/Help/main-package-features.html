<h1>Package Features</h1>
<div class=pagebody>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<ul>
  <li>Ease of use. Put a <b>TDKLanguageController</b> on the form, save the project (this will automatically create a
      language source file) and add a couple of lines to program code: you get a functional multilanguage application!
      See the <a href="main-supplied-examples.html">included examples</a> to learn the details.
  <li>Full integration with Delphi VCL component library. A possibility of automated change tracking in structure or
      properties of forms, frames, data modules etc., and owned components. 
  <li>Complete <b>Unicode</b> support.
  <li>Storing property values for <b>String</b> (UnicodeString), <b>AnsiString</b>, <b>ShortString</b> and <b>WideString</b> properties.
      Storing property values of class <b>TStrings</b>, <b>TCollection</b> item properties and
      property values of <b>TPersistent</b> descendants. Only the properties recognized by the Delphi streaming mechanism as
      <i>stored</i> are processed to avoid storing excessive data.
  <li>A possibility for defining a set of string constants for a project. A constant is referred to by its name (binary
      name search is implemented). See the <a href="example-constants.html">Constants Example</a>.
  <li>Storing translations in plain-text files, which can be edited with any text editor. However,
      there's a much more convenient tool available for creating the translations,
      <a href="http://www.dk-soft.org/redir.php?product=dktraned&action=viewinfo" target=_blank>DKLang Translation
      Editor</a>.
  <li>Synchronous language switching in all displayed forms by changing the current language of global
      <b>TDKLanguageManager</b> instance.
  <li>Events fired in a non-visual component just before and after the language change.
  <li>A possibility for ignoring any properties, as well as a list of forcibly stored properties recognized as not
      stored. Both lists are formed using name masks (eg, *.Font.Name).
  <li>Automated saving the localization data for the whole project into a so-called language source file (a file having
      .dklang extension).
  <li>A possibility of using the localization mechanism when no visual forms are instantiated (for localizing constants
      only). A possibility of building the project with DKLang runtime package.
  <li>A thread-safe design allowing for proper functioning in multithreaded environment. This allows non-blocking data
      read access with a number of threads at once. 
</ul>
