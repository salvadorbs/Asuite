<p>This is a simple example on using DKLang Package in an MDI application. While it seems to be a quite general task,
  there's a trick to make it live.

<p>The point is that each MDI child is created owned by the parent form (<b>fMain</b>). VCL requires that all owned
  components have unique names across their owner, so you would never be able to have two (or more) instances of a form
  owned by <b>fMain</b> if they aren't renamed.

<p>VCL offers a cheap solution for this: it renames the second instance of fMDIChild to <b>fMDIChild_1</b>, third to
  <b>fMDIChild_2</b> and so on.

<p>But we want all of the forms being translated from the same section of the language file, don't we? So our answer to
  VCL's behaviour is that we set <b>fMDIChild.lcMain.SectionName</b> to '<b>fMDIChild</b>', and now that works.
