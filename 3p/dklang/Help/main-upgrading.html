<h1>Upgrading from previous versions</h1>

<h2>Upgrading from 3.x</h2>

<p>Starting with Delphi 2009 the VCL now natively supports Unicode, so it no longer makes sense to use TntUnicode
   (or its successor TMS Unicode) within DKLang.  So the TntUnicode requirement has been removed.  Keeping either 
   component package in your applications should be possible, but it is now no longer necessary to use either set to 
   get full Unicode capabilities.</p>

<p>No changes have been made to the internal storage mechanisms that require conversion of your projects or language
   files.  Some functions that return AnsiStrings have been removed. You should now be able to use the 'W' version 
   instead of the 'A' version without issue. The following functions have been eliminated:
<ul>
  <li>TDKLanguageManager.DKLangConstA[]</li>
  <li>DKLangConstA()</li>
</ul>
</p>  
  

<h2>Upgrading from 2.x</h2>

<p>The following moments should be considered:
<ol>
  <li>DKLang starting with version 3.0 outputs language source files (.dklang) solely in Unicode. It is also preferable
      to use Unicode translation files (.lng) as well, but the package still can read ANSI files produced by version
      2.x. It uses LANGID parameter value to properly convert file contents into Unicode, so loading a translation takes
      a bit longer because the loading occurs twice (first time to determine the language ID, and second time to load
      the file with a correct code page).<br>
      To be able to load Unicode .dklang and save Unicode .lng files you have to upgrade DKLang Translation Editor to
      version 3.0 or later (if available). The program will warn you if you will try to save ANSI translation based on
      an Unicode source, and vice versa.
  <li>DKLang starting with version 3.0 stores constants in a separate resource file (<i>project_name</i>.dkl_const.res)
      instead of project resource file (<i>project_name</i>.res). This allows editing constants in Delphi 2005 and later
      thus overcoming inaccessibility of project resource interface (IOTAProjectResource) in those IDEs (this bug was
      introduced in BDS 2005 and still persists in BDS 2006).<br>
      If you were using DKLang 2.x constants, you should convert all your projects using the
      <a href="#converter_v2">Converter</a>, and add the following line to project source files (.dpr):<br>
      <div class=code>{$R *.dkl_const.res}</div>
</ol>

<h3><a name="converter_v2"></a>Converter from 2.x</h3>

<p>File: <b>Converter_v2\DKLang_Converter_v2.dpr</b>

<p>Compile the converter using your IDE (most recent DKLang version must be installed before) and use it to split
  project resource file <i>project_name</i>.res to DKLang constant resource file <i>project_name</i>.dkl_const.res, and
  optionally to remove constant resources from the project file (you must remove it or duplicate resource name will be
  reported).

<p>You can also <a href="http://www.dk-soft.org/redir.php?product=dklang&action=download" target=_blank>download</a> a
  precompiled Converter executable.
